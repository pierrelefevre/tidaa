Input:
nodes: Collection of all nodes in the system
availablePaths: All remaining nodes to check
value: Weight of step between neighbors

Output:
via: Previous node traversed to arrive at current node
cost: Cost accumulated through the travel to that point

availablePaths = nodes
for path in availablePaths
	path.cost = Infinity

start.cost = 0
next = start

while availablePaths is not empty
	next = node in availablePath with lowest cost
	availablePaths.remove(next)

	for neighbor in next.neighbors
		if neighbor.cost > next.cost + neighbor.value
			neighbor.cost = next.cost + neighbor.value
			neighbor.via = next
